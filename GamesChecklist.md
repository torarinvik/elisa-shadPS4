# shadPS4 macOS Games Checklist

`Acquired` here means the game is currently present in the `Games` folder as a title-ID directory.

| Acquired | Game | Title ID | Details |
|---|---|---|---|
| [x] | EA Sports UFC | CUSA00264 | Tested. Runs, then hits the known render black-screen bug. Strict watchdog shows the black frame starts upstream of final presentation; next step is VideoOut compute input tracing for shader `0xc455a5aa2c447041`. |
| [x] | UFC 2 | CUSA01968 | not tested |
| [x] | Hasbro Family Fun Pack | CUSA03312 | Tested. Initially quit when entering fullscreen; after macOS permission/restart it ran further. Needs current retest for exact playable state. |
| [x] | Joe's Diner | CUSA03774 | Tested. Starts and accepts movement input from arrow keys/left stick, but expected keyboard button bindings such as X/C/Z did not work. Needs input mapping follow-up. |
| [x] | Yooka-Laylee | CUSA05721 | Tested. Boots into scene/menu path, but has severe flicker/distortion/missing geometry and did not advance from the "press X" prompt with keyboard X. |
| [x] | Tokyo Twilight Ghost Hunters Daybreak: Special Gigs | CUSA06045 | Tested. Boots and reaches in-game visual-novel scenes. Input combo prompt `R1 + Square` maps to keyboard `U + Z`; game appeared to work normally during the initial test. |
| [x] | UFC 3 | CUSA06534 | Tested. Reaches the loading percentage screen, then strict render validation aborts on an out-of-bounds image view request: `R16G16B16A16Uint` image has 1 layer but the view requests `base_layer=2`. |
| [x] | UFC 3 Patch v1.14 | CUSA06534-patch | Patch folder; not tested independently. |
| [x] | Beast Quest | CUSA09052 | Tested. Starts, plays audio/narrator, then reaches a black screen similar to the UFC black-screen bucket. Also showed startup flicker/distortion. |
| [x] | SEGA Mega Drive Classics | CUSA09771 | Tested. Reaches the "press button to continue" screen, then enters a black-screen state while audio/game logic continues. No strict render-validation assert was captured in this run; log is dominated by repeated metadata texture-read warnings and net stub spam. |
| [x] | The Witch and the Hundred Knight 2 | CUSA10135 | not tested |
| [x] | EA Sports UFC 4 | CUSA14204 | Tested. Reaches the first loading screen, then aborts in Metal/MoltenVK texture-view validation: source texture is `MTLPixelFormatDepth16Unorm` but the requested view format is `MTLPixelFormatR16Uint`. |
| [x] | Zero Strain | CUSA18570 | Tested. Exits almost immediately in the known fixed-address mapping bucket: `sceKernelMapNamedDirectMemory` requests `0x4000000000`, which overlaps the macOS Apple-Silicon GPU-reserved address hole, then the game hits an access violation. |
| [x] | New Super Lucky's Tale | CUSA20302 | Tested. Reaches the start screen; when pressing a button to advance, strict render validation aborts on unsupported `B4G4R4A4UnormPack16` 2D image creation with sampled/color-attachment usage. |
| [x] | Race With Ryan Road Trip Deluxe Edition | CUSA23279 | not tested |
| [x] | Katamari Damacy Reroll | CUSA24361 | not tested |
| [x] | Stray | CUSA24899 | not tested |
| [x] | Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge | CUSA30991 | Tested. Works well enough to reach startup, main menu, and gameplay after fixing the flexible-memory/`sceKernelMunmap(0, ...)` quit path. Startup music works; user observed no in-game audio yet. |
| [x] | Gigantosaurus: Dino Sports | CUSA43402 | not tested |
| [ ] | Another Sight | CUSA15308 | Tested, then removed from folder. Blocked by fixed mapping around `0x4000000000`, which overlaps the macOS x86_64-on-Apple-Silicon reserved address hole. |
| [ ] | Minecraft Dungeons | CUSA18797 | Tested, then removed from folder. Blocked by the same fixed `0x4000000000` mapping issue. |
| [ ] | Taxi Chaos | CUSA20527 | Tested, then removed from folder. Blocked by the same fixed `0x4000000000` mapping issue. |
| [ ] | Severed Steel | CUSA30139 | Tested, then removed from folder. Blocked by the same fixed `0x4000000000` mapping issue. |
